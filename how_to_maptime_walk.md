## Want to host a MaptimeLA walk?

### Goals/Purpose/Why?:
1. To have fun outside, for free. To explore the great areas of Los Angeles with others.
2. **To add features, trails to OpenStreetMaps**: We can scope out areas to find things to map.
3. **To teach, practice and learn map navigating skills and map apps**: We can practice using paper maps, map apps, of all kinds.

### Beforehand:
1. **Trail Leaders**: Should map out the area, get a general distance/time-frame. They should recommend how to get to the start area by Metro and car. They should be willing to give their phone numbers/contact info to interested walkers. Ideally, they should try ot go to the area too.
2. **Organizers**: Beforehand: Post the information on Meetup.com. Tell people to bring hat, water, even more water, good shoes, paper maps/clipboard, even more and more water, and sunglasses.
3. **Map Leaders** Print out maps of the area, and bring a clipboard. It's fun to compare and contrast several maps of the same place. 

### Day of: tips for trail happiness
1. Day of: Wait for a while at the trailhead/meeting spot. Post on Meetup.com your location and status.
2. If someone does drive, it's great to have someone who brings a First Aid Kit, extra water, extra beverages. Thanks Jon H for doing that at our Fish Canyon Hike!
3. Assign someone to be a: 1) Timekeeper, watch the time to make sure we don't miss the last Metro ride home, 2) Cameraperson, take pictures of everything, 3) Mapper, note the location of important things: parking lot, trail head, signs, interpretive posters, things like that.
4. **Maptime means no one gets left behind** - This is a "no-drop" hike/walk. Group walking tip: If there is/are some people who are at the very end and getting far behind, re-organize the group so that that person is first. The fastest walker should be last. That way, no one gets left behind. 

### Afterwards: Documentation
1. **Camerapeople**, Take photos of all the trail markers, signs, interpretive signage you see. Try to get addresses or Lat/Lon points for relevant areas: parking lots, trail head signs, forks in the road.
2. **Map Leaders**, Save the URLs of where you got the paper PDF maps. Look at USGS, USDA, NPS, local county, city maps. 
3. **OSMers**, Add flora, fauna, waterfalls, trails, whatever we find on OSM.
4. **Documentarians**, Add all those links, photos and OSM tags from 1,2,3 and put it in our Maptime Walks archive. (Forthcoming!)
